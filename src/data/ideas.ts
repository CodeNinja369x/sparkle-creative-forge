    description: "Create a futuristic cityscape that blends neon lights with organic elements, featuring floating buildings and bioluminescent vegetation.",
    longDescription: "This prompt explores the convergence of technology and nature in a distant future. The setting is a vast metropolis where traditional architecture has evolved to incorporate living materials.\n\nBuildings don't just exist alongside nature - they are nature, with walls that breathe and facades that change color based on air quality and time of day. The city is illuminated by both artificial neon lights and natural bioluminescent plants that have been engineered to provide sustainable lighting.\n\nIn the distance, floating structures hover above the ground, connected by transparent walkways, while flying vehicles navigate between them.",
